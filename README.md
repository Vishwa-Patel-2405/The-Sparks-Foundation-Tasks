# The-Sparks-Foundation-Tasks
This repository has several tasks which are given to me by The Sparks Foundation. All the tasks which I have implemented are presented with the proper explanation.

Getting the message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing an *.ipynb on a GitHub blob page.

 - Probably a problem with the GitHub notebook viewing tool - sometimes github fails to render the ipynb notebooks, I believe that is some temporary (and recurring) issue with their backend

Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

This is for the demo purpose, I have given the solution for one of my tasks :

 - Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
 - Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/Vishwa-Patel-2405/The-Sparks-Foundation-Tasks/blob/main/Other%20Domain%20Tasks/Task-1_Optical_Character_Recognition.ipynb") there and then you get "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Vishwa-Patel-2405/The-Sparks-Foundation-Tasks/blob/main/Other%20Domain%20Tasks/Task-1_Optical_Character_Recognition.ipynb"
